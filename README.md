# TO DO

-   Add a button on the adventure response that lets us save our trip
-   On the my trips page, populate the trips that the user has saved
    -   When clicking on a saved trip, load that trip onto it's own page with more details (fun fact, weather, accessories);
-   Implement weather API to pop up when a user selects one of their trips. Will need to implement some kind of cards for the data
-   Implement Journeys form to tie into database
